# Set the working directory in the container for all subsequent commands

# --- Dependency Installation ---
# Copy only the requirements file first to leverage Docker's build cache.
# This step is only re-run if requirements.txt changes.

# --- Application Code ---
# Copy the entire shadowblade application code into the container

# --- Environment ---
# Add the application directory to the PYTHONPATH so modules can be found.

# Google Cloud Run uses the PORT environment variable to send traffic to your app.

# --- Run the Application ---
# Define the command to run when the container launches.
# Using '-m' runs the module as a script, which works perfectly with our PYTHONPATH setup.
