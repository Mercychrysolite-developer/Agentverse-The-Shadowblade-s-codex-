# Shadowblade Agent Design Document

## 1. Overview
The Shadowblade agent is a specialized AI entity within the Agentverse, designed to excel in combat scenarios. Its primary function is to interpret battlefield commands, identify enemy weaknesses, select the most effective weapon from its arsenal, execute attacks, and report the outcome. The agent operates autonomously once a command is issued, leveraging its understanding of enemy types and weapon properties to make optimal tactical decisions.

## 2. Agent Capabilities

### 2.1 Core Combat Logic
- **Target Identification**: The agent can parse commands to identify the specific enemy (e.g., "The Weaver of Spaghetti Code", "The Colossus of a Thousand Patches").
- **Weakness Analysis**: For a given enemy, the agent can determine its primary weakness (e.g., "tangled lines of code", "Revolutionary Rewrite"). This information is crucial for weapon selection.
- **Weapon Selection**: Based on the identified enemy weakness, the agent intelligently selects the most suitable weapon from its available toolkit. Each weapon has properties that make it more or less effective against certain weaknesses.
- **Attack Execution**: Once a weapon is chosen, the agent simulates or executes an attack, calculating damage and potential special effects.
- **Outcome Reporting**: After an attack, the agent provides a concise report of the combat outcome, including damage dealt, effects applied, and any other relevant combat statistics.

### 2.2 Arsenal Management
- **Weapon Inventory**: The agent maintains an internal inventory of available weapons, each with unique attributes (damage type, base damage, critical hit chance, special effects).
- **Weapon Properties**: Each weapon is associated with specific properties that indicate its effectiveness against certain enemy weaknesses. This could be a simple tag system (e.g., "Slashing" vs. "tangled lines of code") or a more complex mapping.

## 3. Agent Architecture

### 3.1 Main Components
- **Command Processor**: Interprets incoming battlefield commands and extracts key information such as target enemy and desired action.
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores information about enemies (weaknesses) and weapons (properties, effectiveness against weaknesses).
- **Decision Engine**: Utilizes the Knowledge Base to make tactical decisions, primarily weapon selection based on enemy weakness.
- **Combat Simulator**: Executes the attack, calculates damage, and applies effects based on weapon properties and enemy defenses.
- **Report Generator**: Formats and outputs the combat outcome in a clear and concise manner.

### 3.2 Integration Points
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication**: The agent will communicate with other agents or a central game system using the A2A protocol for receiving commands and reporting outcomes.
- **MCP (Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol) Server**: The agent will interact with an MCP server to discover and utilize available tools (weapons). The MCP server will expose the weapon toolkit.

## 4. Example Flow
1. **Command Received**: The Shadowblade agent receives a command: "Attack 'The Weaver of Spaghetti Code'."
2. **Target Identification**: Command Processor identifies "The Weaver of Spaghetti Code" as the target.
3. **Weakness Analysis**: Decision Engine queries the Knowledge Base and determines "The Weaver of Spaghetti Code" is weak against "tangled lines of code."
4. **Weapon Selection**: Decision Engine consults the Weapon Inventory and selects "Forged Broadsword" due to its "Cleave" special effect, which is effective against "tangled lines of code."
5. **Attack Execution**: Combat Simulator calculates damage and applies the "Cleave" effect.
6. **Outcome Reporting**: Report Generator outputs: "Shadowblade attacked The Weaver of Spaghetti Code with Forged Broadsword, dealing 135 damage. Cleave effect applied, hitting multiple tangled lines of code."

## 5. Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Weapon Acquisition**: Allow the agent to acquire new weapons during gameplay.
- **Advanced Tactical Decisions**: Incorporate more complex decision-making, such as prioritizing targets or using defensive maneuvers.
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Enable the agent to learn from combat experiences and adapt its strategies over time.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Develop more sophisticated coordination mechanisms with other agents for combined attacks or support roles.
