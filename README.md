#AgentVerse The shadowblade project

This project was built during the google cloud labs - "Agentverse workshop" .Being a developer Implemented and extended the project as part of the hands on lab
The Shadowblade: A master of the forge and the front line. i'm the artisan who crafts the blades, builds the tools, and faces the enemy in the intricate details of the code. 
my path is one of precision, skill, and practical creation.
##My work 
-Deployed on google Cloud Run: [live demo link] ([https://agentverse-dungeon-645631340923.us-central1.run.app/pre-combat]
(https://agentverse-dungeon-645631340923.us-central1.run.app/mini-boss))
successfully completed the codex. I took a "vibe," translated it into a design, and used Gemini CLI to assemble an intelligent agent. 
I inscribed Wards of Purity to test its logic, built an automated gauntlet to forge it into an artifact, and unleashed it into the Agentverse.
Finally, i validated its purpose in a live-fire trial. i have mastered the full-stack agentic workflow and are now ready for any challenge the Agentverse throws at me.
-Exported project to github for review
